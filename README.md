# Checking-Account-Management
This project implements a simple yet functional Bank Account Management System in Python. It simulates basic banking operations through an interactive command-line interface.
The system allows users to:
Create new bank accounts
Deposit money into accounts
Withdraw funds
Check account balances
Delete existing accounts
View total number of accounts
Display details of all accounts
Check the total money in the bank
The core of the system is the AccountManagement class, which handles all account-related operations. It maintains a private dictionary to store account details and provides methods for each banking function.
The program runs in a loop, presenting users with a menu of options. It includes error handling to manage scenarios like insufficient funds, non-existent accounts, or invalid inputs.
This project serves as a practical example of how basic banking operations can be simulated in a programming environment.
